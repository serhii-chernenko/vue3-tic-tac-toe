# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, your task is to create a working Tic-Tac-Toe game.
For those unfamiliar with the game, [here are the rules](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Tic-Tac-Toe).

## Requirements

- The game should allow 2 players on the same device to alternate clicking on the game board to add an X or an O
- When someone get's 3 in a row, the game should stop and the winner be announced
- Once the game is finished, the user should be able to start a new game.

## Other Considerations

> If you see an any `data-test` property in the boilerplate don't remove it
> it is needed. If you remove it your code may be invalid for the certificate.

> TailwindCSS is preinstalled and with default config.
> It might be helpful for you if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise.
